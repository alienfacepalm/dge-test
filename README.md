## Code Problem

We will be sending a customer through a flow with branches and actions that have corresponding linkage.

Write a function that will give you the desired results based on the customer's JSON properties.

#### Notes

- Use the branches are expressions and determine which action will happen in correspondance.
- Actions without branches will be root actions.
- Work backwards to determine the chain of actions based on next action property.
